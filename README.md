# Utility
This repo consists of some important codes which were useful for my research projects.

The following functions are implemented. Most of the functions are implemented in Python using MPI for speed up. Instructions to install the required libraries will be uploaded later. 

1. Convert Gatan DM4 movie format.
2. Convert Direct Electron (DE) SEQ file format.
3. Download a video from youtube (Does not work on live streaming).
4. Convert a video into sequence of images.
5. Convert a sequence of images to a movie.
6. Create fft image of an image sequence.
7. More to come!
